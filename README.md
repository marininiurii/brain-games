## About

Brain-games are five mini-games that develop mathematical and logical thinking. If you like solving puzzles, you will love this. When starting any of the five games, the user receives a greeting, the rules of this game are explained to him, followed by a question or a mathematical expression and waiting for the user's answer. Each game takes place in three rounds, if the answer is wrong, the game shows the correct answer and ends.
